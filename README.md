### Netflix_series_data_analysis
---
### Data analysis of popular shows and streaming services like: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+ .
### People justify spending time in the evening in front of a television or computer for many reasons. A lot of people want to relieve stress from a hard day at work or just take some time to slow down for the night. Everyday households with a Netflix account can sit down in front of a television, start watching a series and escape from reality. But suddenly, hours and hours have gone by and the one episode the household sat down to watch has now become many episodes. This problem of people losing track of time while watching series television shows is being called the “Netflix Effect.” People find that they cannot just watch one episode of a show because they have to find out what happens next.
